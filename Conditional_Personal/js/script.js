Conditionals Personal
 */

//Create conditionals for something personal to me.
//This will be based on checking variables to see if I am in a hazard or not in golf

//Creating variables for type of lie my ball was hit in.
//if the ball was hit in the fairway print to the console, "Great Job!"

var fairway = prompt("Did you hit the ball in the fairway?");
var greatJob = (fairway);

if(fairway){
    alert("Great Job!");
    console.log("Great Job!");
}
