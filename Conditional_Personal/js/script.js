Conditionals Personal
 */

//Create conditionals for something personal to me.
//This will be based on checking variables to see if I am in a hazard or not in golf

//Creating variables for type of lie my ball was hit in.
//if the ball was hit in the fairway print to the console, "Great Job!"

var hitDriver = prompt("How many yards is the hole?");
//variable ripIt designated to hit it hard!
var ripIt = ();
//variable for relax.
var layUp = ();
//creating conditional logic based on user generated information.
if(hitDriver >= 250){
    ripIt();
}else{
    layUp();
